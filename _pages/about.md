Roberto, born in 1984, hopeless (but shameless) geek.

I have been told that my philosophy on RPGs presupposes a very strong social contract and mutual trust. This is absolutely true. I believe that bringing certain attitudes to the table simply goes beyond the purpose of having fun.

In my teens I wanted to roleplay, but I didn't have a group and was too shy to seek one out. Later I finally had the chance to join a group and we played a completely random version of D&D 3.5 and at the same time I attended some Vampire LARPs. The first experience ended because the group went into soft air (!), the other because I didn't like the attitude of the LARP players.  
After that, crisis of rejection and things of life (thesis, first jobs 12/7, the usual things of average twenties) kept me out of the loop.

I got interested again in the summer of 2019, first hoarding *Risus* and *Lasers & Feelings* and all the hacks available around. Then I bought *Legends of Andor* on sale and I was back into dungeon delving. Then pandemic broke out and the group of friends I was playing Andor with was unable to meet face-to-face, so I improvised a game using *Sword & Six-siders*. I haven't stopped since.

My favorite RPGs are:
- [*White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventures*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190631/White-Box--Fantastic-Medieval-Adventure-Game) and [*Swords & Wizardry*](https://www.froggodgames.com/product/swords-wizardry-complete-rulebook/).
- [*Classic Traveller*](https://www.farfuture.net/) and [*Cepheus Engine*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/186894/Cepheus-Engine-System-Reference-Document) (which I translated with some nice people).
- In general everything that is Old School/R.
- I also think that if we weren't too picky [*Risus*](https://www.risusrpg.com/) and its [*Companion*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/203657/Risus-Companion) would be more than enough.

I am also member #1511 of the [*International Order of Risus*](https://www.risusiverse.com/home/ior-charter).
