Hi there, I am starting this new "venture" hosting my first blog in English about RPGs, specifically those games I like to call ["adventure game"](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) whose definition, as Ben Milton addressed a while ago:

> - It implies authentic peril and the possibility of loss.
> - It implies strangeness, travel, the unexpected, and the confusing.
> - It implies variety and an episodic structure, a picaresque rather than a novel.
> - It implies cleverness, ingenuity, and cunning rather than a bloody slog.
> - It implies characters like Conan, Luke Skywalker, Elric, Hellboy or Fafrd.
> - It’s short, simple, and isn’t obscure. Episodic-high-stakes-open-ended-lateral-problem-solving-fantasy-game > might - be more accurate, but good luck with that catching on.
> - It evokes (in my head) a game that’s simple, unpretentious, and focused on fun at the table.

My attitude for the sake of this miscellany of thoughts will be adherent with the [NSR philosophy](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/01/19/what-is-the-nsr-part-1) (originally stated [here](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/)), with my personal take:

NSR games have:
- A Referee [*originally "A GM", I prefer Referee as Game Master brings a heavy baggage of preconceptions about the figure of the facilitator to the table*]
- An Unique Setting [*originally "A Weird Setting", which is too narrowly focused on a certain genre that I love, but it is better to keep us more "ecumenical"*]
- A Living World

are:
- Rules Light
- Impartial [*originally "Deadly", again I think that the focus is on the impartiality of the whole game system rather than deadliness itself which is only a consequence*]

and focus on:
- Emergent Narrative
- Shared Objectives
- Player Choices
- Wonder & Discovery [*originally "Exploration"*] (this comes from [SagedaMage](https://sagedamage.blogspot.com/))

Maybe in the future I will try to elaborate on each point from my perspective.
