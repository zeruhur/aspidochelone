I have never fished, all the knowledge I have about it comes from movies and a [wikihow guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Fish) I just read.

So why am I posting this mini-game? Because a challenge has been issued in a group I participate in: pay the [Joeski Tax](https://joeskythedungeonbrawler.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/house-rule-for-osr-and-not-osr-games-people-blogs/) using [this chart](http://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/02/joesky-tax-preparation.html). And I rolled 67 ("Fishing minigame!"). And so I couldn't shirk my responsibilities.

But it's not as if you necessarily have to use this gimmick....

# Fishing Mini-Game

## Fishiness - Roll 2d6

2-3: dead waters -> don't even try, move on the next pond  
4-5: poor -> DM -2  
6-8: normal -> DM 0  
9-10: abundant -> DM 1  
11-12: rich -> DM 2  

## Tools - Roll 1d6

1-2: hands -> DM -1  
3-4: fishing net -> DM 0  
5-6: fishing rod -> DM +1

## Bait effectiveness - Roll 1d6

1-2: bad -> DM -2  
3-6: good -> DM 0

## Fish Size & Strength - Roll 2d6

2-3: Tiny -> TN 7  
4-5: Small -> TN 9  
6-8: Medium -> TN 11  
9-10: Big -> TN 13  
11-12 Huge -> TN 15

## How to fish
1. Determine all the factors in dis/advantage rolling on each table.  
2. Roll a 3d6 and apply any relevant Dice Modifier (DM). If result is equal or greater than Target Number (TN), you catch the fish.
